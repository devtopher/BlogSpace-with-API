This is a mock blog posting page built to learn and demonstrate usage of API for GET and POST requests. This was a project completed for the Scrimba Front End Career Path. I really enjoyed the process of building this out. This was the first work I have done that included APIs so it was great to learn how to interact with the JSON placeholder API which can be found here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

I had a lot of fun with the styling of this project as there were no styling suggestions from Scrimba and I just got to create what I thought worked well. 

The biggest challenge for this project was a refactor that we did. The initial code that I wrote was not DRY and would have gotten messy quickly. Creating the renderPosts function was the biggest part of the refactor and allowed me to quickly add new posts to the array by using the unshift method.

Thanks for checking out this project!
